            Welcome to the absurd world of the Girton Spring Ball! We are so
            excited to welcome you on Friday 18th March 2022! A link to the
            ticketing platform can be found here as well as all the information
            you need for the night. Our vision for the 2022 ball is to revive
            and celebrate the Girton community after a challenging two years, by
            way of a fun and responsible full-scale party. The theme of
            Absurdism perfectly reflects both the strangeness of recent
            collective experience whilst also celebrating the creativity and
            light-heartedness of our long history of Spring Balls. As Camus said
            “The realisation that life is absurd cannot be an end, but only a
            beginning…”. We mean to start as we mean to go on.
