## Girtonians only

All students must vacate college by 5pm (restrictions on entry from 4pm) on Friday 18th. A map and programme of events will be provided on the day of the ball.

## Entry

Doors will open at 9pm. We recommended that you arrive in advance of this time to avoid waiting in a long queue.

Taxis will enter through Mares Run and drop off at the top of Orchard Drive. Guests will then walk over to the entrance of the ball under the arch on Tower Drive. Queue Jump ticket holders should also arrive from 9pm but join a priority queue.

## Admission

Before admission to the Ball is allowed, ticket holders must present:

* their valid ticket
* photographic identification consistent with the name their ticket is booked under
    * The only acceptable forms of photographic identification are a driving license or any passport.
    * Ticket holders without a valid ticket or piece of photographic identification will not be admitted to the Ball.
    * University cards are not acceptable identification for admission to the Ball. 
* certification consistent with our covid policy (see below)

## Covid policy

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
A previous email sent to ticketholders on the 16th of March incorrectly implied that a covid test was mandatory for entrance. Below is the actual policy, which is consistent with the terms and conditions associated with your ticket.
{{< /alert >}}

For entry to the Ball, you will require one of the following:

1. Proof of full vaccination in the form of an NHS Covid pass or equivalent

2. Evidence of a negative PCR or Lateral Flow test taken no earlier than 5 pm 17th March 2022. Lateral flow tests taken at home will need to be reported into the public reporting system https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result so they appear on your phone.

3. Proof of natural immunity shown by a positive PCR test result for Covid-19 lasting for 180 days from the date of the positive test and following completion of the self-isolation period. 

4. Evidence that you have a medical exemption for being tested for or vaccinated against covid 19. (This should be submitted in advance, by Monday 14th March to covidtest@girton.cam.ac.uk).
